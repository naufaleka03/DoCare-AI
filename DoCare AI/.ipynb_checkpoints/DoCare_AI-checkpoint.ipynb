      "What is (are) Eye Diseases ? Some eye problems are minor and don't last long. But some can lead to a permanent loss of vision.    Common eye problems include       - Refractive errors    - Cataracts - clouded lenses    - Glaucoma - a disorder caused by damage to the optic nerve    - Retinal disorders - problems with the nerve layer at the back of the eye    - Macular degeneration - a disease that destroys sharp, central vision    - Diabetic eye problems    - Conjunctivitis - an infection also known as pinkeye       Your best defense is to have regular checkups, because eye diseases do not always have symptoms. Early detection and treatment could prevent vision loss. See an eye care professional right away if you have a sudden change in vision, if everything looks dim, or if you see flashes of light. Other symptoms that need quick attention are pain, double vision, fluid coming from the eye, and inflammation.    NIH: National Eye Institute\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy ? At first, you will see a few specks of blood, or spots, \"floating\" in your vision. If spots occur, see your eye care professional as soon as possible. You may need treatment before more serious bleeding or hemorrhaging occurs. Hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep. Sometimes, the spots clear without treatment, and you will see better. However, bleeding can reoccur and cause severely blurred vision. You need to be examined by your eye care professional at the first sign of blurred vision, before more bleeding occurs. If left untreated, proliferative retinopathy can cause severe vision loss and even blindness. Also, the earlier you receive treatment, the more likely treatment will be effective.\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Age-related Macular Degeneration ? The most common symptom of dry AMD is slightly blurred vision. You may have difficulty recognizing faces. You may need more light for reading and other tasks. Dry AMD generally affects both eyes, but vision can be lost in one eye while the other eye seems unaffected. One of the most common early signs of dry AMD is drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often are found in people over age 50. Your eye care professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam.\n"
